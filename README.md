## Overview

This is a mini project for the **Principle of Programming Languages course (CO3005)** at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (VNU-HCM) that implements a compiler for **HLang**, a custom programming language designed for educational purposes.

ðŸ“‹ **For detailed language specification, see [HLang Specification](hlang_specification.md)**

The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of compiler construction including:
- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenization and error handling for invalid characters, unclosed strings, and illegal escape sequences
- **Syntax Analysis**: Grammar-based parsing using ANTLR4 (ANother Tool for Language Recognition)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for both lexical and syntactic errors
- **Testing Framework**: Automated testing with HTML report generation

## Answers of programming code in class and homework (exercises)

All of them were saved in the **data** folder.
